# Project Categorization Schema

This document outlines the official schema used for classifying projects within the Document Intelligence Processor application. The schema is divided into two main components: **Project Categories** (the technical domain) and **Project Scope** (the nature of the work).

## 2. Project Scope

This classification defines the **nature or scale** of the project execution.

-   **Greenfield Project:** A new facility built from the ground up on a new site.
-   **Brownfield Revamp / Expansion:** Significant modifications, upgrades, or expansions to an existing, operational facility.
-   **Standalone / Component Project:** A single, discrete unit of work (e.g., a single compressor, a specific pipeline segment).
-   **Study / Consulting Project:** Non-construction deliverables (e.g., feasibility studies, safety audits).
